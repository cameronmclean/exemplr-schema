## Pattern exemplification core concepts schema
### This document defines and provides the vocabulary to talk about relations between a design pattern and an example of its instantiation.
### Many aspects of design patterns and exemplars/annotations can be descibed using existing vocabularies eg dublin core - and where suitable we prefer to use these terms directly rather than invent new subclasses of them here
### This document therefore only covers the intrinsic core pattern emeplification elements, and is intended to be extsnsible and evolvable.
